I'm currently a Postdoctoral Associate at New York University's [Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics](https://cosmo.nyu.edu/). A copy of my CV may be found [here](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/smsharma/CV/raw/master-pdf/cv.pdf).

**Research Interests:**
I work at the intersection of particle physics, astrophysics, cosmology, and statistics. I'm interested in developing and applying novel statistical techniques---especially those based on machine learning---to accelerate searches for new physics. 
 
**Publications and Code:** 
My publications can be found on [INSPIRE](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1394493) or [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/y66hOF7ySaKvYhjCkixRiA), with an overview of recent work given [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/publications.md %}). I'm passionate about open and reproducible research, and code associated with most of my papers may be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/smsharma).

<!-- **Contact:** I can be reached by [email](mailto:sm8383@nyu.edu). I'm also happy to grab a [virtual coffee ☕](https://calendly.com/smsharma/virtual-coffee). -->

**Previously:** Prior to starting at NYU I obtained my Ph.D. from Princeton in 2018, working under the supervision of [Mariangela Lisanti](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/mariangela-lisanti) with my [dissertation](http://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp012v23vx15d) focusing on astrophysical searches for dark matter. Along the way, I've been fortunate to have worked on experimental particle physics [early on in graduate school]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/pdf/experimental_project.pdf %}) and as a Summer Student at CERN. I completed my undergraduate studies at Peterhouse, Cambridge in the UK where I read the Natural Sciences (Parts I and II) and Mathematics (Part III) Triposes. I grew up in Moscow, Russia. 

**Misc.:** I enjoy [biking around New York City]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/img/nyc.jpg %}) and [hanging out with my cat,]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/img/toph2.jpg %})  [Toph]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/img/toph1.jpg %}).
