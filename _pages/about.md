Hi! I'm currently an IAIFI Fellow at the [NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions (IAIFI)](https://iaifi.org/), affiliated with the [Center for Theoretical Physics](https://physics.mit.edu/research/labs-centers/center-for-theoretical-physics/) at MIT and the [Department of Physics](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/) at Harvard.

My pronouns are he/him.

**Contact:** 
I can be reached via [email](mailto:smsharma@mit.edu). I am happy to chat with students at IAIFI and the Boston area about potential projects.

**CV:**
A copy of my CV may be found [here](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/smsharma/CV/raw/master-pdf/cv.pdf).

**Research Interests:** My work uses probabilistic machine learning -- combining deep learning, generative modeling, differentiable programming, and statistics -- to accelerate searches for fundamental physics using astrophysical and cosmological data at all observable scales. I am broadly interested in the application and development of AI techniques to a wide range of problems in the physical sciences.

**Papers, Code, and Tutorials:** 
- Papers can be found on [INSPIRE](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1394493), [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/y66hOF7ySaKvYhjCkixRiA), or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=hJVjhlwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
- Code associated with all of my projects may be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/smsharma).
- Tutorials on [simulation-based inference](https://github.com/smsharma/sbi-lecture-mit), [deep probabilistic programming](https://github.com/smsharma/deep-prob-prog-tutorials), and [self-supervised & multimodal machine learning](https://github.com/smsharma/iaifi-hackathon-2024/tree/main/multimodal_ssl).
- Slides for [lectures on generative modeling](/iaifi-summer-school-2023/) at the IAIFI Summer School 2023.
- A curated list of resources and papers on [neural simulation-based inference](https://github.com/smsharma/awesome-neural-sbi).

**Previously:** 
Prior to MIT/IAIFI I was a postdoc at NYU's [Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics](https://cosmo.nyu.edu/) from 2018-2021. I obtained my Ph.D. in Physics from Princeton University in 2018, working under the supervision of [Mariangela Lisanti](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/mariangela-lisanti) with my [dissertation](http://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp012v23vx15d) focusing on astrophysical searches for dark matter. Along the way, I've been fortunate to have worked on experimental particle physics [early on in graduate school]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/pdf/experimental_project.pdf %}) and as a Summer Student at CERN. I completed my undergraduate studies at Peterhouse, University of Cambridge in the UK where I read the Natural Sciences (Parts I and II) and Mathematics (Part III) Triposes. I grew up in Moscow, Russia.

**Misc.:** 
I enjoy [road cycling]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/img/bike_cold_spring.jpg %}) and [hanging out with my cat,]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/img/toph2.jpg %})  [Toph]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/img/toph3.jpg %}).
