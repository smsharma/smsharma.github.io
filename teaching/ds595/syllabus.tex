\noindent\textbf{Course Description:}
AI is increasingly central to how science gets done, spanning simulation, experiment, theory, and observation. This course aims to equip students with the methods to understand and carry out research at the intersection of AI and the natural sciences. Topics include probabilistic inference, neural networks that encode physical symmetries and domain knowledge, generative models for scientific data, and simulation-based inference. \emph{While framed in terms of scientific applications, the methods discussed extend well beyond scientific research, with broad applicability across industry and general AI R\&D.}

Applications are drawn from domains including physics, materials science, and biology. The course involves two assignments emphasizing method design and critical analysis in collaboration with AI tools, plus two projects: a midterm applying AI methods to a scientific problem, and a final project finetuning an LLM to elicit a scientific capability.

A major focus of the course is on large language models and their emerging role in science. As LLMs become more capable of scientific reasoning and operating autonomously, understanding how to evaluate, adapt, and collaborate with these systems is becoming essential. We explore what it means to work alongside AI scientists, and how to critically assess their capabilities as well as limitations.

\vskip.15in
\noindent\textbf{Learning Objectives:} By the end of this course, students will be able to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Apply probabilistic inference and sampling methods (e.g., MCMC) to scientific problems
\item Design neural networks that encode scientific domain knowledge
\item Train generative models (e.g., diffusion models) to emulate scientific data distributions
\item Use simulation-based inference to connect simulators with observations
\item Evaluate the edges and limitations of LLM capabilities for scientific reasoning
\item Develop intuitions for how to collaborate effectively with AI systems on research tasks
\item Read and understand AI-for-science research papers
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Assignments \& Components:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Discussion Labs.} Weekly in-class labs reinforce lecture material through hands-on programming. Students work through a notebook during discussion, exploring implementations and comparing results. Graded on participation and completion.
\item \textbf{Assignments.} Two assignments ask students to propose a novel method (or modification to an existing method) and then understand/critique it through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. AI tools may be used freely, but the analysis and interpretation require critically engaging with what was produced.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Assignment 1: Design and stress-test a novel sampling or variational inference method
    \item Assignment 2: Design and stress-test a novel neural network architecture or inductive bias
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Midterm Project.} Teams of 2--3 conduct a mini research project applying methods from the first half of the course (inference, architectures, generative models) to a scientific problem. Choose from a suggested list or propose your own. Deliverable is a $\sim$4 page workshop-style paper + code.
\item \textbf{Final Project.} Teams of 2--3 identify a scientific capability that current LLMs struggle with, then finetune a language model to improve that capability. This is a two-stage project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Proposal: Demonstrate that LLMs struggle at a specific scientific capability by curating a dataset or benchmark
    \item Final report ($\sim$6 pages, NeurIPS format): Fine-tuned model and evaluation showing improvement, including artifacts used for fine-tuning (datasets, code, reinforcement learning environments)
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Course Policies:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Attendance.} Regular attendance in lectures is expected. Please notify the instructor of planned absences.
\item \textbf{Late Work.} Late submissions are not accepted without prior arrangement. Extensions may be granted for documented emergencies.
\item \textbf{Collaboration.} Discussion of concepts and approaches is encouraged. However, all submitted code and written work must be your own. When collaborating, you must acknowledge your collaborators.
\item \textbf{AI Tools.} Learning to work effectively with AI is itself a course objective. Use AI tools freely to explore ideas, debug code, and deepen understanding. Focus on building genuine competence---understanding \emph{why} something works, not just \emph{that} it works. Disclose AI assistance in submissions, including its form and extent. See also the \href{https://www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/culture-community/gaia-policy/}{CDS GAIA policy}.
\item \textbf{Recordings.} Recording of lectures requires instructor permission. Students approved for recording as an accommodation must limit use to personal study and may not share recordings.
